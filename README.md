<i>Thanks for stopping by</i>
## Welcome
If you find joy in the simple things like using a tool that you created, learning a new shortcut, or just discovering anything else that makes the way you interact with your computer more efficient or enjoyable then you're like me. While projects like [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git) or [sl](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl.git) didn't make me an awesome programmer, they sparked an odd fascination early on that influenced the way I see and appreciate software. With that said, if you happen to be reading this then I hope you find something that interests you.

<b>Also...</b> please feel free to offer any suggetions or mock me for being amazed by things like being able to use <kbd>^</kbd><kbd>A</kbd> and <kbd>^</kbd><kbd>E</kbd> instead of holding down the left/right arrow keys to navigate in the command line.
