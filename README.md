<i>Thanks for stopping by...</i> :)
## Welcome
If you find joy in the simple things like using a tool that you created, learning a new shortcut, or just discovering anything else that makes the way you interact with your computer more efficient or enjoyable then you're like me. While projects like [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git) or [sl](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl.git) didn't make me an awesome programmer, they sparked an odd fascination early on that influenced the way I see and appreciate software. With that said, if you happen to be reading this then I hope you find something that interests you.

<b>Also...</b> please feel free to offer any suggetions or mock me for being amazed by things like being able to use <kbd>^</kbd><kbd>A</kbd> and <kbd>^</kbd><kbd>E</kbd> instead of holding down the left/right arrow keys to navigate in the command line.

## Helpful Commands

| Command  | Description | Example Use Cases |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `ls -ltr`  | View folders & files sorted by modification time where the bottom-most file/folder was modified most recently   |_Great for sorting through directories with a lot of log files & for finding newly downloaded files/folders_|
| `cd -` | `cd` with the `-` argument brings you to the last directory that you visited before the current working directory. | _This is very helpful when hopping back and forth between two different directories_|

## Shell Essentials
_To preface this section, I don't use the default shell that ships with MacOS/Linux and opt for the <b>zsh</b> shell along with [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git) which is a framework that helps you manage zsh configurations (note: oh-my-zsh also lets you utilize several awesome plugins)._

<b>Important:</b> ZSH and Oh-My-Zsh are prequisites for a lot of tips in this repository. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git) if you want to live a better life with a better shell.
